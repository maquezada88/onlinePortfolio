                    <h2>Martin Quezada</h2>
                    <p>I am a computer science graduate from James Madison University who is looking forward to kickstart their software engineering career. 
                        I also have an AS in computer science from Noerthern Virginia Community College where I graduated with a Pathways Scholarship. 
                        I am most comfortable coding in Java and python, but love to learn new leanguages and technologies! 
                        My favorite courses I learned about were Algorithms and Data Structures, Computational Geometry, and Database Management! 
                        Safe to say I love learning about concepts that can be applied to real world problems and solutions. 
                        In addition, I am also Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Foundation certified, and have completed Cisco's and 
                        J.P. Morgan's virtual experience on Forage. My current favorite hobbies are working out, video games, watching anime, 
                        and experiementing with new programming languages!</p>

                <div class="row">
                    <div class="box">
                        <h1 class="headings">24</h1>
                            <p>
                                A mathematical game programmed in python where the user uses basic arithmetic to get the sum of 24 with 4 given numbers. 
                                The set of numbers are stored in a json file, and are retrieved based on the difficulty (easy, medium, hard) the user decides upon.
                                 A random number is used to select out of the 5 set of numbers each difficulty contains. 
                                This was my first program coded in python on my own, and is primarily focused on modularity, OOP, and safe practices in order to get to know the language. 
                                There is a Java version on github to get an understanding of how I was going to implement it. 
                                There is also a responsive web app based on this program in html, css, and javascript. <a href="game/game.html">Check it out here.</a>

                        <h1 class="headings">Server-Client</h1>
                            <p>
                               A program that consists of a server and a client. The server receives requests from a UPD transport 
                               layer protocol. The program then reads the requests and applies proper arithmetic in order to send the result to the client.
                               the result is then displayed on the clients side at the end of the program. This code is to show how servers and clients interact,
                               and how requests behave and interact with one another.
